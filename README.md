# snpsettest

The goal of the **snpsettest** package is to provide simple tools that perform a
set-based association test using GWAS summary statistics. This package is
currently in alpha testing.

```R
remotes::install_github("HimesGroup/snpsettest")
```

## TODO

- [ ] Write a user manual
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Remove redundancy in package import
- [ ] Add user friendly console output
- [ ] Re-expose some useful functions to end users
