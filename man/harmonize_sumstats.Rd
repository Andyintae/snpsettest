\usage{
harmonize_sumstats(
  sumstats,
  bigsnpobj,
  join_by_id_only = FALSE,
  check_strand_flip = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sumstats}{A data frame with columns: "snp.id", "chr", "pos", "a1",
"a2" and "p".
\itemize{
\item snp.id = SNP ID (e.g., rs numbers)
\item chr =  chromosome (must be integer)
\item pos =  base-pair position (must be integer)
\item a1, a2 = allele codes (allele order is not important)
\item p = p value of SNP
}

It could have only two columns "snp.id" and "p" if \code{join_by_id_only = TRUE}.}

\item{bigsnpobj}{A \code{bigSNP} object created using the reference data.}

\item{join_by_id_only}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, SNP matching will be
performed by SNP IDs only. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{check_strand_flip}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}. If \code{TRUE}, the function 1)
removes ambiguous A/T and G/C SNPs for which the strand is not obvious,
and 2) attempts to find additional matching entries by flipping allele
codes (i.e., A->T, T->A, C->G, G->A). If the GWAS genotype data ifself is
used as the reference data, it would be safe to set \code{FALSE}. With
\code{join_by_id_only = TRUE}, it simply determines whether to remove ambiguous
SNPs. Default is \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A data frame with columns: "snp.id", "chr", "pos", "a1", "a2" and
"p".
}
\description{
Finds an intersection of variants between GWAS summary and reference data.
}
\details{
Pre-processing of GWAS summary data is required because the sets of variants
available to a particular GWAS might be poorly matched to the variants in
reference data. SNP matching is performed using chromosome code, base-pair
position, and allele codes, while taking into account possible strand flips
and reverse reference alleles. For matched entries, the SNP IDs in summary
data are replaced with the ones in the reference data.
