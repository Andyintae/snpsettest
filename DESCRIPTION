Description: The goal of 'snpsettest' is to provide simple tools that perform
             set-based association tests (e.g., gene-based association tests)
             using GWAS summary statistics. A set-based association test in this
             package is based on the statistical model described in VEGAS
             (versatile gene-based association study), which combines the
             effects of a set of SNPs accounting for linkage disequilibrium
             between markers. this package uses a more efficient method than the
             original VEGAS implementation for computing a set-level p-value,
             significantly reducing computation time.
